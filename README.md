## What is this?
Extratropical cyclones (ECs) play an important role in the generation of precipitation at mid-latitudes. This dataset contains positional and meteorological data, as well as two-dimensional masks and a variable for moisture uptake associated with precipitation from ECs in the North Atlantic during extended winters from 1985 to 2022.

## Data and models
Data:
-ERA-5 reanalysis from the ECMWF (Hersbach et al., 2020)

Models used:
-The regional high-resolution model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) (Skamarock et al., 2008)
-The Lagrangian FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART-WRF) (Brioude et al., 2013)

Softwares used:
-EuLerian Identification of ascending AirStreams (Quinting & Grams,2022) [ELIAS 2.0](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5154980)
