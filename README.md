## What is this?
This dataset contains positional and meteorological data, as well as two-dimensional masks and a variable for moisture uptake associated with precipitation from extratropical cyclones in the North Atlantic during extended winters from 1985 to 2022.

## Data
We use high-resolution WRF simulations.
